# Car_counter

This program allows to detect vehicles in a road, and try to keep the trajectory of it, so it can count the number of cars going trough someplace, this can be highly improved with Convolutional neural networks to rteduce the noise and add classifiers
(This is just a demonstration of image background substraction for movement detection in opencv 3)
